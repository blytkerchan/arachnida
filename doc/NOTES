== Don't link libSpin statically ==
libSpin depends on the constructors of a few private, static objects for its
initialization. As these objects aren't referenced anywhere in the code, you
cannot link libSpin statically without losing those objects and the
initialization they perform. I.e. *all* of the library must be linked in in
order for libSpin to work.
